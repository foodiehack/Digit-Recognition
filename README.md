# Digit-Recognition
<ul>
  <li>For now it can detect one digit at a time.</li>
  <li>If you have a low end PCs you can skip the training part as I have uploaded the weights. </li>
  <li> You can directly put the link of the image or put the path of the image.</li>
  <li>Real time digit recognition coming soon</li>
 </ul>
